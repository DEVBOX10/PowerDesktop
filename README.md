    <h3>Why PowerDesktop is no longer supported in Win32?</h3>
    <br />
    The Power Desktop project is a new branch of the Windows desktop.  Power Desktop will    revolutionize the Windows desktop and bring many innovations to the system.  The Windows desktop has not been fundamentally updated since Windows 98, but times are changing and you need to follow them.  Windows desktop looks poor compared to other systems such as Android & iOS, and to counter them in the market, we are pushing a new Windows desktop solution with Microsoft and partners.  Power Desktop aims to update the look and feel of the desktop.  The new Windows desktop environment will be built on Universal Windows Components to give the desktop a new, universal experience.  The Power Desktop project will initiate a new universal Windows shell that will run on top of the Windows Core OS kernel and support the launch of Win32 applications within an MSIX-packaged application container on devices that support it.  Together with the Power Desktop project, a new era of Windows versatility begins, as well as the release of new Windows-based devices.  Windows is important for the consumer market no less than the market for expensive business devices, therefore, we will take maximum care of supporting devices based on the update of Windows versions 1709 and 1703. I shield that all people in the world can use Windows anytime, anywhere, on every phone, computer or tablet.  on Xbox or HoloLens, TVs and IoT devices.
