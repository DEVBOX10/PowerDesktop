                <hr />
                <br />
          <p class="article-text">
            <b>What do you need to know?</b><br />
            <br />
            Mini-apps are replacements for old live
            tiles. We make sure that you can access
            important information for you without
            being distracted by launching
            applications. 
            You can now interact with the Outlook
            widget and reply to mail or create
            calendar events with just a few clicks
            right from the widget panel.<br />
            <br />
            <h2>What's new?</h2>
            <b>Design improvements</b><br />
            <br />
            As you can see, the new widgets have been
            significantly redesigned in terms of the
            user interface. For example, the title
            and icon of the widget are now separated
            from the main content, and new control 
            buttons and widget settings have been 
            added. This greatly simplifies 
            interaction with widgets. Updated and 
            redesigned weather widget also get fluent
            design clean look. <br />
            <br />
            <b>Fast actions</b><br />
            <br />
            Now, when you click on the network 
            control button, you can quickly turn on 
            or turn off Wi-Fi, see the available 
            connections, as well as the network speed. 
            When you press the Bluetooth button, you
            can see a list of connected devices, as
            well as their battery charge. You can 
            also use fast actions to quickly access 
            various system settings. You can add your
            custom fust actions. For me, it's really 
            cooolll feature.<br />
            <br />
            <b>Outlook widget improvements</b><br />
            <br />
            In this major 1.5 update, we also fixed bugs related to Outlook mail and added the
            ability to share a pinned contact. It also became possible to quickly delete an
            event from the calendar and view the event associated with a specific date.<br />
            <br />
            Also added:<br />
               - New mail view dialog;<br />
               - Local events;<br />
               - Update interval;<br />
               - Updated design;<br />
            <br />
            <b>Redesigned settings</b><br />
            <br />
            Options now open in a widget pop-up dialog, making them useful on any type of device. <br />
            <br />
            <b>Quick access to widgets using Application commands. (Coming soon)</b><br />
            <br />
            Right-clicking on the widget bar icon in the Windows taskbar will open the gadget launch menu. It is very convenient that the gadget runs on top of all windows if you run it this way. <br />
            <br />
            <b>New sharing features.(Coming soon)</b><br />
            <br />
            Windows Share will now be able to open links in the Edge browser or quickly search selected text. <br />
            You can easily pin the site you want to the widget ribbon using the share feature in Microsoft Edge. <br />
            SO, I think it's really cooolll feature! <br />
            <br />
            <b>Start menu, resize and replace widgets feature.</b><br />
            <br />
            Now you can resize the widget or move it. Several resizing options are available.<br />
          	• Small<br />
          	• Medium<br />
          	• Large<br />
            <br />
            You can also change the position of the widgets. Depending on the size of the widget, the information on it may change. <br />
            <br />
            <b>New command bar</b><br />
            <br />
            The 1.5 update added a new command bar. Thanks to which it has become even easier to manage widgets. Also in the command bar there are quick actions and a settings button with a Microsoft account. The command bar also has something like a "start" button that allows you to add or remove, as well as move widgets.<br />
            <br />
            <b>Full screen mode and new personalization features.</b><br />
            <br />
            An equally interesting feature is the ability to personalize the widget feed. Now, starting from version 1.5, you can set the background image of the widget ribbon, adjust the blur effects and change the theme color. It also became possible to set your own (custom) image. <br />
            <br />
            <b>Microsoft Edge widget(Preview).</b><br />
            <br />
            Introducing the Microsoft Edge Widget in Power Widgets! Now you can quickly and easily search the web using the search bar in the Microsoft Edge widget right in the widget bar. The search bar in the widget supports interactive search. <br />
            <br />
            <b>What is interactive search?</b><br />
            <br />
            Interactive search is designed for quick search on the Internet, or rather in specific resources. You can quickly switch between search engines and resources where you should find something. <br />
            <br />
            Supported places for searching(at the moment): <br />
          	• Bing<br />
          	• Google<br />
          	• DuckDuckGo<br />
          	• Yahoo<br />
          	• Wikipedia <br />
          	• YouTube <br />
          	• Spotify <br />
          	• Peoples<br />
          	• Maps<br />
          	• Microsoft Store<br />
          	<br />
          	<b>Pin your favorite sites to Microsoft Edge widget.</b><br />
          	<br />
          	You can pin your favorite sites directly to the widget panel using the Microsoft Edge widget. Just open the desired site in the Edge browser and click the share button, then select Pin to Power Widgets, your site will be pinned to the Microsoft Edge widget. You can also use the quick site pinning button and pin the site without opening a browser. <br />
            <br />
            <b>Microsoft Edge widget search history.</b><br />
            <br />
            You can view or clear your search history by switching to the History tab in the Microsoft Edge widget. <br />
            <br />
            <b>Personalization</b><br />
            <br />
            Now you can customize the widgets feed for yourself by choosing the proposed wallpaper or applying your own, you can also change the accent color of the theme in the application or adjust the transparency and blur mode. <br />
            <br />
            <b>Free mode for widgets</b><br />
            <br />
            You can run widgets in free mode. In this form, the widget that you run in free mode will be launched on top of all windows and you can interact with it separately from the main widgets feed, this is like picture-in-picture mode, but for widgets only.<br />
            <br />
            <b>Context commands for widget feed launcher icon on taskbar.(Coming soon)</b><br />
            <br />
            Well, if for some reason you do not want to open or switch to the widget ribbon, just right-click on the Power Widgets application icon and you can launch the widget you need on top of all windows. (Free mode) <br />
            <br />
            <b>Conclusion</b><br />
            <br />
            In general, update 1.5 is not bad, but there are a few more features that will come to us already on 1.5.1. The next update, namely 1.5.1, will be small and should generally be aimed at improving performance and adding small functionality. Let it be the secret of which one. <br />
